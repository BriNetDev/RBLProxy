RBLProxy - DNSBL Scoring System

Overview

RBLProxy is a public DNSBL proxy hosted at rblproxy.clientnshosting.net. RBLProxy offers a streamlined solution to consolidate multiple DNSBLs (like Spamhaus and Spamcop) into a single, smart DNSBL, eliminating the need to configure each DNSBL separately.

RBLProxy operates as a scoring system to identify high-risk IP addresses. By aggregating data from several trusted DNSBLs, it flags only those IPs that appear on multiple lists—effectively reducing false positives while enhancing spam protection.

How It Works

When a query is made to RBLProxy using an IP address (formatted in reverse), the service checks this IP against multiple DNSBLs. If an IP is listed on enough DNSBLs to reach a high-risk consensus, RBLProxy blocks it by returning:

- A Record: 127.0.0.2
- TXT Record: “IP is blacklisted due to presence on multiple RBLs”

If the IP doesn’t meet this threshold, RBLProxy responds with NXDOMAIN, meaning the IP is considered safe.

This scoring approach prioritizes accuracy and reduces the chances of false positives, making RBLProxy an ideal choice for email servers, spam filters, and other security systems.

Recent Updates

- PTR Hostname Validation and Scoring: Enhanced filtering accuracy with checks on PTR hostnames.
- Domain Blacklist Integration: Adds another layer of protection by checking blacklisted domains within PTR records.
- Spammy TLD Scoring: Recognizes and scores TLDs commonly associated with spam, providing even stronger defenses.

Getting Started

RBLProxy is freely available and can be easily integrated with low-volume email systems or custom security scripts. To start, simply query rblproxy.clientnshosting.net with any IP in reverse format.

Feedback and Support

RBLProxy is a personal project I developed to hep make the internet a safer place. It is provided openly and as-is, with no guarantees or warranties. Feedback is always welcome, as it helps improve the service.
